    The Chinese zodiac is a cycle of 12 years, with each year being represented by an animal.
    The 12 animals are: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig.
    The cycle repeats every 12 years. The years of the Chinese zodiac are determined by the Chinese calendar.
    The Chinese calendar is based on the cycles of the moon, and each month begins on the day of the new moon.
    The Chinese zodiac is based on a 12-year cycle, with each year in that cycle related to an animal sign.
    The 12-year cycle is an approximation of the 11.86-year orbital period of Jupiter around the sun.
    The 12-year cycle is also related to the 12 signs of the zodiac in Western astrology.
    The Chinese zodiac is used to represent years, months, days, and hours.
    The Chinese zodiac is also used to represent people born in a particular year, month, or day.
    The Chinese zodiac is used to determine a person's personality, compatibility with others, and fortune for the year.
    The Chinese zodiac is also used to predict the luck of a person or a business.
